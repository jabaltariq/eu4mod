 vinlandevents_1_title: "The Vinland Sagas"
 vinlandevents_1_desc: "Hundreds of years ago, the brave explorer Leif Erikson discovered Vinland. After establishing a main base of operations, our ships, long ago, were destroyed, and many brave settlers were trapped. We've been stranded for many years, with different Jarls rising and falling, failing to bring Vinland out of stagnation. The beloved Jarl Sven, living a long life, is now on his deathbed, however this represents a change greater than anyone could imagine. Tired of the years of stagnation, of struggling to survive, the vikings of Vinland are ready to throw off the chains of complacence. There are two powerful factions in the Vinlander ranks: one supports Sven's grandson and heir, and longs to conquer the rest of this strange land and forge a new empire. However, the opposing faction supports Sven's nephew, Ragnar. This faction desires to reestablish contact with the land we left behind so many years ago, and to forge a new empire."
